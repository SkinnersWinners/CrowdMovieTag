CrowdMovieTag (working title)
=============

CrowdMovieTag is a web application that allows users to tag movies with genres, elements, actors, etc. Doing so builds a database of tags connected to films, which can then be queried by users seeking a movie to watch (or whatever their motivation). Users can also vote tags up or down depending on whether they think the tag is accurate or not.

CrowdMovieTag is brought to you by Skinner's Winners (also working title), an organization consisting of:
